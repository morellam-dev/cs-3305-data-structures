## Execution

These programs were written to be compiled individually within an interactive terminal. While most of them are simple enough to be cross-compatible, they have only been tested in version 10 of the GNU compiler, using the GNU++17 dialect.

```sh
module_1> gcc --version
gcc-10 (Homebrew GCC 10.2.0) 10.2.0

module_1> g++ -std=gnu++17 **.cpp && ./a.out
```
