## Execution

These programs were originally written to be compiled individually through an interactive terminal, specifically using g++-10. However, for convenience, I have created an extremely naive makefile which compiles every module into a separate executable in the `out` directory.

```sh
bash$ make
# ... make output ...
bash$ ls out/
# ... list of executables ...
bash$ ./out/1_2_pyramid
8 6 4 2 0
6 4 2 0
4 2 0
2 0
0

$ make clean
rm -r ./out/
```
