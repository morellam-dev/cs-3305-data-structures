# CS 3305 Data Structures

Instructor: Seokjun Lee

## Homework Assignment 3

## Objectives

The goal of assignment 3 is to reinforce the beginning C++ concepts and efficiency of
algorithms concepts, and to reinforce the implementation of Object Oriented concepts in C++.
Specifically, the assignment is to do the following:

## Requirements

Implement the **sequence** class from chapter 3.2. Pay special attention to the documentation on
pages 128 and 129 in Figure 3.9 **sequence1.h**. Create a program **sequence1.cpp** that will
demonstrate the features of this class. Include comments that describe the expected output in
each case. Figure 3.10 on pages 134, 135, and 136 provide a test program **sequence_test.cpp** for the sequence class. Use the test program to test your class implementation.

## Submitting Assignment

**When we have only nonprogramming assignment,**

Please submit **One document .doc** file by including the following:

1. Both Typed or Handwritten answers for the questions are allowed.
2. Take a picture of your handwrtten answers, and add it to .doc file is allowed.

**When we have programming assignment,**

Please submit **One Compressed .zip** file by including the following:

1. Copy and Paste your source codes & screenshots of your output in MS Word .doc;
2. Include, all your source codes (.cpp file & all the associated program files) in the .zip file;
3. Be sure to include **// comments** in your files documenting your name, the assignment number.
4. Submit your assignment **.zip file** through D2L [http://d2l.kennesaw.edu/](http://d2l.kennesaw.edu/) dropbox using the appropriate assignment link.
