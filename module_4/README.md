# CS 3305 Data Structures

Instructor: Seokjun Lee

## Homework Assignment 4

## Requirements

The goal of assignment 4 is to reinforce the dynamic classes in C++. Specifically, the assignment
is to implement the polynomial class from chapter 4.6 on page 212. But the additional
requirement is to implement the class using a dynamic array to store the coefficients. The class
needs to have a destructor, copy constructor, and an overloaded assignment operator. The
following files are provided for your reference. You should start by modifying the header file
first.

1. poly0.h: The header file for the preliminary polynomial class.
2. polytest0.cpp: A small interactive test program.
3. polyexam0.cpp: A small non-interactive test program

Remember, all those files are only work for static array implementation. You should modify them
to make the dynamic array implementation work. I will use non-interactive test program to
grade your homework.
